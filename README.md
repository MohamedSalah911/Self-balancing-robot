# Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot  

This repository contains all the resources, code, and documentation for a **two-wheeled self-balancing robot** developed as part of our controls and measurements course project. The goal of the project is to design, simulate, and eventually build a robot capable of maintaining balance using control systems.

## **Project Overview**  
A self-balancing robot is a fundamental example of applying control systems theory to a real-world problem. This project explores the design and implementation of a control strategy to stabilize the robot's upright position using sensors and actuators.  

### **Key Objectives:**  
- Simulate the dynamic behavior of the robot.  
- Design and implement a control system (PID).  
- Explore sensor fusion and motor control techniques.  
- Use ROS for advanced functionalities and potential real-world testing (planned).  

---

## **Features**  
- **MATLAB Simulink Model:** Simulates the robot's dynamics and control response.  
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Ensures stability and balance.  
- **ROS Integration:** Facilitates sensor data handling and communication.  
- **Hardware Design:** Basic layout constructed on TinkerCAD for proof of concept.
